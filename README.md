# ```QUIRM```


**QUantum Interface for Regular Modularity**


I'll add the doc. One day. Maybe.


## WARNING


This code is not finished, far from it. The API may change, some very unsafe code will be removed.
More modules will come. But the core concept is here.


### Note concerning the current code

The actual code does nothing, or next to. This is normal. I'm working on the bootloader. 
Please notice that it does nothing, but with style: no dep, reproducible env with nix, 
build and run with one command.
